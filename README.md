# WebShare
Share to social media sharing pages directly from the Android share menu without needing the native apps

One disadvantage of using major social networks' mobile websites instead of native apps is that you cannot share links directly from the Android share menu, you must instead share to the clipboard then manually paste into the website. WebShare will redirect Android native shares to the social networks' "sharer" URLs, simulating the native app sharing experience.

Note that the sharer URLs do not support direct image sharing. To share images this way first share via an alternative image sharing app (such as Imgur) and then reshare from there via WebShare to post on a social network.
